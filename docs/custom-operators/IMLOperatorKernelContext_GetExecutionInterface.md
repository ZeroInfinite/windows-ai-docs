# IMLOperatorKernelContext.GetExecutionInterface method

Returns an object whose supported interfaces vary based on the kernel type. For kernels registered with [MLOperatorExecutionType::Cpu](MLOperatorExecutionType.md), *executionObject* will be set to **nullptr**. For kernels registered with **MLOperatorExecutionType::D3D12**, *executionObject* will support the [ID3D12GraphicsCommandList](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nn-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist) interface. This may be a different object than was provided to [IMLOperatorKernelCreationContext::GetExecutionInterface](IMLOperatorKernelCreationContext_GetExecutionInterface.md) when the kernel instance was created.

```cpp
void GetExecutionInterface(
    _COM_Outptr_result_maybenull_ IUnknown** executionObject)
```
