# IMLOperatorTypeInferrer interface

Implemented by type inferrers to infer the types of an operator's output edges. Type inferrers must be provided when registering schema of custom operators if the [MLOperatorSchemaDescription](MLOperatorSchemaDescription.md) structure cannot express how output types are determined&mdash;for example, when an attribute of the operator determines the data type of one of that operator's outputs.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [InferOutputTypes](IMLOperatorTypeInferrer_InferOutputTypes.md) | Called to infer types of an operator's output edges. |
