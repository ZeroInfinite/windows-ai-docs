# IMLOperatorShapeInferrer interface

Implemented by shape inferrers to infer shapes of an operator's output tensor edges. Shape inferrers may be provided when registering custom operator kernels to improve performance and to enable the kernel to query the shape of its output tensors when it is created and computed. Shape inferrers may also be provided when registering custom operator schema to improve model validation.
